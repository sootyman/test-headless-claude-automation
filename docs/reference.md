```

Two human touchpoints: (1) write the requirements doc, (2) review and merge PRs.

---

## The Full Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Requirements to Stories

The `/pipeline` command (`.claude/commands/pipeline.md`) runs locally in the Claude Code CLI.

1. You write a requirements doc in `docs/requirements/`
2. Run `/pipeline docs/requirements/your-feature.md` (optionally add a git URL as a second argument to build on an existing codebase)
3. If a starter codebase URL was provided, Claude clones it, copies files into the project root (preserving template infrastructure), commits, and pushes
4. Claude reads the doc and breaks requirements into agent-sized stories (each completable in <30 turns), referencing existing files if a starter codebase was imported
5. Creates GitHub Issues with structured descriptions and applies the `agent:ready` label

The `agent:ready` label is the trigger. Stories with unresolved dependencies do not get the label until their blockers are merged.

### Phase 2: Dev Agent Spawns

GitHub Issues labeled `agent:ready` trigger `claude-dev.yml`.

1. A fresh `ubuntu-latest` VM is provisioned by GitHub Actions
2. The repo is checked out, Node.js is set up, dependencies are installed
3. `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` launches Claude Code in headless mode
4. The agent reads the GitHub Issue, reads `CLAUDE.md` for project rules
5. Implements the feature, writes tests, runs them
6. Updates issue checkboxes in real-time as it completes each requirement
7. Commits, pushes a branch, opens a PR with a `Closes #N` reference
8. The VM is destroyed. All local state is gone.

Multiple issues can trigger simultaneously. Each agent runs on its own VM with its own context window.

### Phase 3: Automated Review

The PR triggers two review systems:

**Claude Review Agent** (`claude-review.yml`):
- Runs `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` in headless mode
- Reviews the diff against your project's review checklist (defined in the workflow)
- Checks security, architecture, test coverage
- Posts structured review comments on the PR

**CodeRabbit** (optional, external):
- 40+ linters and security scanning
- Inline code comments
- Configured via `allowed_bots` in the review workflow

If the review agent finds issues, the fix agent triggers automatically.

### Phase 4: Auto-Fix Loop

Bot review comments trigger `claude-fix.yml`.

1. A third headless Claude agent reads the review feedback
2. Fixes every issue raised
3. Runs tests and type checks
4. Pushes a commit: `fix: address review feedback [autofix 1/5]`
5. The review agent re-reviews (triggered by the new commit)
6. Loop continues up to 5 iterations
7. If still unresolved after 5 attempts, comments and stops for human help

Only bot review comments trigger the fix agent. Human comments do not trigger it, preventing unintended fix loops.

### Phase 5: Human Review and Merge

1. You review the PR (read the agent's conversation log, not just the diff)
2. Approve and merge, or leave comments for another fix cycle

## Template Feature Inventory

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Agent | Max Turns | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Dev Agent | `claude-dev.yml` | `agent:ready` label, issue assignment, `@claude` comment | Yes | 40 | Implement feature from issue |
| Review Agent | `claude-review.yml` | PR open/update, review comment, `@claude` on PR | Yes | 10 | Review PR against checklist |
| Fix Agent | `claude-fix.yml` | Bot review comments only | Yes | 15 | Fix review feedback (5 iteration cap) |

### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

| Command | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `/pipeline` | `pipeline.md` | PM Agent: reads requirements doc, optionally imports a starter codebase, creates GitHub Issues, applies `agent:ready` label, monitors progress |
| `/review` | `review.md` | 3-iteration QC review: (1) correctness, (2) architecture, (3) security/performance |

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

| Agent | File | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| Security Reviewer | `security-reviewer.md` | Read, Grep, Glob | OWASP-focused security review subagent |

### Hooks (`.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/hooks/`)

| Hook | Type | Matcher | What It Does |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| Branch Protection | PreToolUse | `Edit\|Write` | Blocks all file edits on the `main` branch |
| Destructive Blocker | PreToolUse | `Bash` | Blocks force pushes, recursive deletes, database drops |

### Permissions (`.claude/settings.json`)

| Rule | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Auto-allow | Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch |
| Deny | Edit/Read of `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` |

### Other Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions read by every agent (local and headless) |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/story.yml` | Structured issue template with checkboxes for agent progress tracking |
| `.gitignore` | Ignores node_modules, env files, build artifacts, test results, IDE files, tasks/ |

## Tool Permission Layers

Every tool call passes through a 6-layer gate system. A tool must pass all layers to execute.

```
Tool call initiated
  |
  v
1. --allowedTools whitelist (headless only)
   If the tool is not in the whitelist, BLOCKED.
   |
   v
2. permissions.deny rules (.claude/settings.json)
   If the tool + path matches a deny rule, BLOCKED.
   |
   v
3. permissions.allow rules (.claude/settings.json)
   If the tool matches an allow rule, SKIP user approval.
   |
   v
4. PreToolUse hooks (.claude/settings.json)
   Shell commands or AI prompts that run before execution.
   Exit code 2 = BLOCK the tool call.
   Exit code 0 = ALLOW the tool call.
   |
   v
5. User approval (interactive only)
   If no allow rule matched and no hook approved, prompt the user.
   In headless mode, unapproved tools are blocked.
   |
   v
6. Tool executes
   |
   v
7. PostToolUse hooks (informational only, cannot block)
```

### Layer Details

**Layer 1: `--allowedTools` whitelist** (headless agents only)

In `claude-dev.yml`, the dev agent's tool whitelist is:
```
Edit, MultiEdit, Write, Read, Glob, Grep
Bash(npm:*), Bash(npx:*), Bash(node:*), Bash(tsc:*)
Bash(mkdir:*), Bash(ls:*), Bash(cat:*), Bash(cp:*), Bash(mv:*)
Bash(chmod:*), Bash(git:*), Bash(gh:*)
```

Blocked by omission: `curl`, `wget`, `docker`, `sudo`, `ssh`, `Task`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `AskUserQuestion`.

The review agent is restricted to: `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git log:*)`, `Bash(git show:*)` (read-only).

**Layer 2: `permissions.deny`**

Prevents any agent (local or headless) from reading or modifying credential files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`).

**Layer 3: `permissions.allow`**

Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, and WebSearch execute without user approval in interactive mode.

**Layer 4: PreToolUse hooks**

Two hooks are configured:

1. **Branch protection** (matches `Edit|Write`): Blocks all file edits on the main branch. Agents must work on feature branches.

2. **Destructive command blocker** (matches `Bash`): Runs `.claude/hooks/block-destructive.sh`. Strips quoted strings and heredocs from the command, then checks for recursive delete patterns, force push patterns, hard reset patterns, and database destruction patterns (SQL and MongoDB). Exit code 2 blocks the command.

**Layers 5-7**: Standard Claude Code behavior (user approval in interactive mode, execution, post-execution hooks).

---

## Hook Execution Model

### PreToolUse Hooks

- Run **before** the tool executes
- Can **block** the tool call (exit code 2)
- Can **approve** the tool call (exit code 0)
- Have a timeout (5 seconds for both hooks in this template)
- Receive tool input via environment variables
- Output is shown to the user if the hook blocks

Two types:
- `"type": "command"` - runs a shell command
- `"type": "prompt"` - sends an AI prompt (useful for semantic checks)

### PostToolUse Hooks

- Run **after** the tool executes
- **Cannot block** - informational only
- Useful for auto-formatting, notifications, or reminders

This template uses PreToolUse hooks only. Add PostToolUse hooks in `settings.json` under the `"PostToolUse"` key for project-specific needs (e.g., auto-lint after file edits).

---

## Agent Lifecycle

### Interactive (Local CLI)

```
Session start
  -> Loads CLAUDE.md, settings.json, commands
  -> Hooks fire on every tool call
  -> Subagents spawned via Task tool (own context window)
  -> Session end: MCP servers terminated, processes cleaned up
```

### Headless (GitHub Actions)

```
VM provisions (ubuntu-latest)
  -> Checkout repo
  -> Setup Node.js, npm ci
  -> anthropics/claude-code-action@v1 starts
  -> Authenticates with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  -> Reads CLAUDE.md + issue/PR context
  -> Runs headless (--max-turns, --allowedTools)
  -> NO MCP servers, NO commands, NO interactive prompts
  -> Hooks still active (PreToolUse fires on every tool call)
  -> VM destroyed: all state lost
```

### What's Shared vs. Isolated

| Shared (via git) | Isolated (per agent) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Source code | Conversation history |
| CLAUDE.md | Context window |
| .claude/settings.json | npm dependencies (fresh install) |
| .claude/hooks/ | File system state |
| .claude/agents/ | Environment variables |

Each agent gets a clean slate. No state leaks between runs.

---

## Secrets and Authentication

| Secret | Where It Lives | Used By |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | GitHub Actions secret | claude-dev, claude-review, claude-fix workflows |
| GitHub token | Auto-provided by Actions | All workflows (via `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`) |
| Claude Max subscription | Local Claude Code auth | Interactive CLI usage |

The template's `.gitignore` excludes `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.production`. The `permissions.deny` rules block agents from reading or editing those files even if they exist.

---

## Cost and Limits

### Per-Agent Costs (Anthropic API)

| Agent | Estimated Cost | Max Turns | Timeout |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Dev Agent | $1-5 per run | 40 | 30 min (GitHub Actions default) |
| Review Agent | $0.50-2 per run | 10 | 15 min |
| Fix Agent | $0.50-2 per run | 15 | 15 min |

### Platform Costs

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| GitHub Actions | Free tier: 2,000 min/mo | Public repos: unlimited |
| CodeRabbit | $15/user/mo | Free for open source |
| Anthropic API | Per-token pricing | 200K context window |
| Claude Max (local) | $100-200/mo | For interactive CLI usage |

### Optimization Strategies

- Keep stories small (< 30 turns) to minimize per-run cost
- The 5-iteration fix cap prevents runaway costs from review loops
- Review agents use read-only tools (lower token usage)

---

## Failure Modes and Mitigations

| Failure Mode | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------------|------|------------|
| **Hallucinated logic** | Agent generates plausible but incorrect code | Review agent catches logic issues. Tests must pass. Human reviews conversation log. |
| **Context window overflow** | Large codebases exhaust context, agent loses constraints | Keep stories small (< 30 turns). Turn limits cap execution. Fresh context per run. |
| **Cost explosion** | Fix-review loop runs many expensive iterations | 5-iteration fix cap. Concurrency groups. Turn limits on each agent. |
| **Error propagation** | One bad commit cascades through dependent stories | Each PR is isolated on its own branch. Branch protection requires review before merge. |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Agent introduces injection, XSS, or OWASP issues | Security reviewer subagent. Review workflow checks for secrets and input validation. |
| **Merge conflicts** | Parallel agents modify the same files | Dependency tracking in /pipeline. Sequence stories that touch the same files. |
| **Agent stalls** | Agent gets stuck in a loop or hangs | Turn limits (40/10/15). GitHub Actions timeout (30 min). Agent shuts down when exhausted. |
| **Infinite fix loops** | Fix agent and review agent disagree endlessly | 5-iteration cap. After 5 attempts, comments on PR and stops for human intervention. |

## Adding Project-Specific Configuration

### Custom PreToolUse Hook (AI Prompt)

For semantic checks (e.g., "does this database query include tenant scoping?"), add a prompt-based hook to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "prompt": "Check if this edit touches database queries. If it does, verify that every query includes tenant scoping. If a query is missing tenant scoping, respond with BLOCK and explain why."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom PostToolUse Hook (Auto-Lint)

Run a linter after every file edit:

```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "npx eslint --fix \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Skill

Create `.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md` with reference material that Claude loads when relevant. Skills are passive - they provide context, not commands.

### Custom Agent

Create `.claude/agents/your-agent.md` with a system prompt for a specialized subagent. Restrict tools to the minimum needed.

### Custom Review Criteria

Edit `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` and replace the TODO comments with your project's specific review checklist.
