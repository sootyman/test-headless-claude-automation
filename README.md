# Agent Pipeline Template

A reusable template for autonomous software delivery using headless Claude agents. Feed a requirements doc in, review pull requests out. Two human touchpoints.

## The problem this solves

Using Claude Code as a pair programmer is productive, but the orchestration overhead adds up fast. You write a requirements doc, then spend hours babysitting the implementation: breaking stories, creating issues, assigning work, reviewing diffs, context-switching between "what should we build" and "let me check what the agent just did." The productivity gains get eaten by the management tax.

The question that led to this template: does Claude actually need you sitting there?

It doesn't. Claude runs headless in GitHub Actions runners the same way we've run headless browsers in CI for years. No IDE. No chat window. Just a process that starts, reads an issue, implements a feature, opens a PR, and shuts down. The agent is gone, but the PR is there - with a full conversation log of every decision it made, every file it touched, every test it ran. It's more transparent than most human-written PRs.

This template contains the complete automation infrastructure - GitHub Actions workflows, Claude Code configuration, and safety hooks - extracted from a production pipeline and stripped of all project-specific code. Fork it, fill in your CLAUDE.md, and you have a working agent pipeline.

## What's in the box

```
.github/workflows/
  claude-dev.yml          Dev agent: reads GitHub Issue, implements, opens PR
  claude-review.yml       Review agent: auto-reviews every PR on open/update
  claude-fix.yml          Fix agent: reads bot review feedback, pushes fixes (5 iteration cap)

.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
  story.yml               Structured issue template with checkboxes for agent progress tracking

.claude/
  settings.json           Safety hooks + permission rules
  hooks/block-destructive.sh
  commands/pipeline.md    /pipeline command (requirements doc -> GitHub Issues -> dev agents)
  commands/review.md      /review command (3-pass QC review)
  agents/security-reviewer.md

CLAUDE.md                 Project instructions skeleton (fill this in)
docs/requirements/        Where requirements docs live
```

## How the automation works

The pipeline turns a markdown requirements document into deployed code with two human touchpoints: writing the doc and reviewing PRs.

### The flow

```
You write a requirements doc (docs/requirements/feature.md)
  |
  v
/pipeline command (Claude Code CLI) — executes immediately, no confirmation needed
  - (Optional) Clones a starter codebase, copies it into the repo, commits and pushes
  - Reads the requirements doc
  - Breaks it into sized GitHub Issues with structured descriptions
  - Applies "agent:ready" label to trigger dev agents
  - Monitors agent progress until all stories are merged or failed
  |
  v
claude-dev.yml triggers (GitHub Actions)
  - anthropics/claude-code-action@v1 spins up a headless Claude agent
  - Agent reads the GitHub Issue
  - Agent checks out the repo, reads CLAUDE.md for project rules
  - Implements the feature, writes tests, runs them
  - Updates issue checkboxes in real time as it works
  - Commits, pushes a branch, opens a PR with a "Closes #N" reference
  - Agent shuts down. The runner is gone.
  |
  v
claude-review.yml triggers (on PR open)
  - A separate headless Claude agent reviews the diff
  - Checks security, architecture, test coverage
  - Posts structured review comments on the PR
  |
  v
claude-fix.yml triggers (on bot review comments)
  - A third headless Claude agent reads the review feedback
  - Fixes every issue raised
  - Pushes a commit: "fix: address review feedback [autofix 1/5]"
  - Review agent re-reviews (triggered by the new commit)
  - Loop continues up to 5 iterations
  - If still unresolved after 5 attempts, comments and stops for human help
  |
  v
You review the PR
  - Read the agent's conversation log (every decision is visible)
  - Approve and merge, or leave comments for another fix cycle
  |
  v
The story is complete
```

The CLAUDE.md file in your repo is what ties it together. It gives every agent the same architectural context, the same rules, the same testing standards. The agents read it the same way a new developer reads a contributing guide on their first day.

### Key design decisions

**Why GitHub Actions, not a persistent agent?** No infrastructure to maintain. Each agent is a fresh GitHub Actions runner that spins up, does work, and self-destructs. No VMs, no pm2, no process monitoring. The workflow YAML is the entire deployment.

**Why separate dev/review/fix agents?** Each agent gets a fresh context window scoped to its job. The dev agent focuses on implementation. The review agent focuses on finding problems. The fix agent focuses on addressing feedback. No context pollution between roles.

**Why real-time checkbox updates?** The dev agent updates issue checkboxes as it completes each requirement, not in a batch at the end. You can watch progress live in the GitHub Issue while the agent works.

**Why a 5-iteration fix cap?** Prevents infinite loops where the fix agent and review agent disagree. After 5 attempts, a human needs to intervene. In practice, most issues resolve in 1-2 iterations.

**Why review the conversation, not the diff?** The PR includes a full log of every decision the agent made. You're not reading diffs line by line. You're reading a narrative of decisions. If the agent made a bad call, you can see exactly where and why.

### Safety mechanisms

- **Branch protection hook**: Blocks all file edits on the `main` branch. Agents must work on feature branches.
- **Destructive command blocker**: Catches force pushes, recursive deletes, and database drop commands before they execute.
- **Credential deny rules**: Blocks reading or editing `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`.
- **Bot-only fix trigger**: The fix agent only responds to bot review comments, not human ones. Prevents unintended fix loops.
- **Concurrency groups**: Only one fix agent runs per PR at a time.
- **Turn limits**: Dev agent capped at 40 turns, review at 15, fix at 15.

### When agents make mistakes

The agents still make mistakes. Sometimes they misread a requirement or take a wrong architectural turn. But the feedback loop is fast: reject the PR, add a comment explaining why, and the agent can try again. A failed attempt costs minutes of compute, not hours of a developer's day.

## Beyond code

This pattern is not specific to software development. The "dev agents" are really just "doer agents." Anything that can be defined in a requirements document and validated against testable criteria can run through this pipeline. The doer agents could be writing compliance reports, processing applications, generating legal drafts, or building marketing copy against a brand guide. The review agents could be checking regulatory compliance, security policies, or just whether the output matches what was asked for.

The human stays in the approval seat, not the execution seat.

## Quick start

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full setup guide. See [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md) for the complete technical reference (tool permission layers, hook execution model, agent lifecycle, cost/limits, failure modes). The short version:

1. Use this template to create a new repo (or copy the files into an existing one)
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to GitHub repo secrets
3. Run `/install-github-app` in Claude Code to install the Anthropic GitHub App
4. Fill in `CLAUDE.md` with your project's architecture, policies, and commands
5. Write a requirements doc in `docs/requirements/`
6. Run `/pipeline docs/requirements/your-feature.md` (or `/pipeline docs/requirements/your-feature.md https://github.com/user/starter-repo` to build on an existing codebase). The pipeline executes immediately — it creates GitHub Issues, triggers dev agents, and monitors progress. No confirmation prompts.
7. Watch the agents work. Review the PRs.

## What you customize per project

| File | What to change |
|------|---------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Everything. This is the source of truth every agent reads. |
| `claude-review.yml` | Replace TODO comments with your project's review criteria |
| `claude-dev.yml` | Adjust `--max-turns`, `--allowedTools`, test/build commands |
| `story.yml` | Add critical-path checkboxes for your project's sensitive areas |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Add project-specific hooks (data isolation, lint, etc.) |
